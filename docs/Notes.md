##### in the defence of using Nez framework.

  In the grand scheme of learning, it would have been better to not use Nez Framework and build the whole project on Monogame alone.    
  It is true, because Nez adds quite a few prebuilt tools to simplify development, it would seem that I am skipping on quite a large amount of knowledge.     
  My counter argument to that:      
  As a beginner [Maybe slightly above beginner lvl] programmer, building such a huge [subj.] project from scratch means failing a lot. Even though I am a stubborn as an ox, failures do demoralise and if in the end I keep failing and have nothing to show, it might force me to give up on the project as a whole.      
  Thus taking baby steps in learning might be more beneficial in the long-run.
