#### Main pillars of the project:

- Game is licenced under GPL3, free forever. This is to avoid a possible scenario when a game gets abandoned just because the main dev lost any interest or jumped out of the window.
- Game should run on [modern] integrated graphics.
- Game does not feature DLCs.
- Project does not accept donations, sponsorships, nor does it include content that a user is required to pay for.
- Project is built on C#.

 Not gonna lie, now I regret not getting all those darn assets from [HB](https://humblebundle.com).

#### Inspiration for this project: [MicroTown](https://www.snowyashgames.com/microtown/).

#### Another inspiration for this project [FireTale](https://lukehollenback.itch.io/firetale).

Both of the games look cool, and I suggest you to check them out!
